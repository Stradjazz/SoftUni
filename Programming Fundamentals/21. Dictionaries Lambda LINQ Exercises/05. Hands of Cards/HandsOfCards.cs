    /*You are given a sequence of people and for every person what cards he draws from the deck. The input will be separate lines in the format: {personName}: {PT, PT, PT,… PT}
    Where P (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A) is the power of the card and T (S, H, D, C) is the type. The input ends when a "JOKER" is drawn. The name can contain any ASCII symbol except ':'. 
    The input will always be valid and in the format described, there is no need to check it.
    A single person cannot have more than one card with the same power and type, if they draw such a card they discard it. The people are playing with multiple decks. Each card has a value 
    that is calculated by the power multiplied by the type. Powers 2 to 10 have the same value and J to A are 11 to 14. Types are mapped to multipliers the following way (S -> 4, H-> 3, D -> 2, C -> 1).
    Finally print out the total value each player has in his hand in the format: {personName}: {value} */
